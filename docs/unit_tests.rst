Unit tests
==============

This library comes with several test pages/assignments:

* pages:  

  * `plain_text` -- source is just plain old text.  start simple, ya know?
  * `uses_latex` -- a page that contains latex math
  * `has_remote_images` -- a page that has remote images embedded
  * `has_local_images` -- a page that uses local images
  * `uses_droplets` -- a page using [the Droplets framework from UWEX](https://media.uwex.edu/app/droplets/index.html).
  * `uses_droplets_via_style` -- a page using [the Droplets framework from UWEX](https://media.uwex.edu/app/droplets/index.html).  The code enabling Droplets comes from a header/footer contained in a style folder.  The main purpose of this test page is the header/footer style thing.
  
* assignments:
* `programming_assignment` -- an assignment that has a local image

The above list is not exhaustive.
