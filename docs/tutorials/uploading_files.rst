How to upload a file 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------



The `meta.json` file
====================

Filenames and titles of files are distinct on canvas: 
the latter is what you will see when the file is placed in a module, while the former is what is shown in the file structure.

You can place a file in as many modules as you wish by specifying the modules in the `meta.json` file. 
The key `module` has a value which is a list of names of modules in the Canvas course. 
If no module with the specified name exists, a module will be created to house the file.

The `destination` key specifies where in the file structure you would like the file to be placed.
