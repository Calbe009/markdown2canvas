This is the first assignment in the course.


## This assignment's description includes some fancy features of `markdown2canvas`

[link to readings for this Lesson](page:Readings for Lesson 1)  <---- a link to another page.  Will be populated only if the page is already published.  I generally publish my whole course twice at the beginning of a term, just like compiling LaTeX to get references and page numbers right.

[An embedded file link](file:ring.stl)

A text replacement will happen $REPLACETHISTEXT.  Note that the dollar sign is NOT special -- it's only special because I used it in a key of the `replacements.json` file.

This text here will get replaced: a source replacement with spaces
