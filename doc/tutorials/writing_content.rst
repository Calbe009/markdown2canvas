Writing content using `markdown2canvas`
-------------------------------------------



The structure of containerized content
========================================

Content under `markdown2canvas` is containerized using regular old folders.  The names of the folders are arbitrary, but I like using suffixes like `.assignment` or `.link` or `.page` to indicate the type of content in the folder.  

The type of content in a folder is really indicated using the `meta.json` file, which should be in any containerized folder.  This file is a regular old JSON file.  It's used to indicate not only the type of the content, but any other traits such as the list of modules in which the content should be listed, point value, submission types, etc.
