A library for containerizing local markdown content to be published into the Canvas learning management system.  

:warning: This library is under active development and the interface is NOT stable.

# Why I wrote/maintain this library

The particular problem this library solves is that of putting Canvas content under version control, and also using Markdown for that content.  Canvas pages are not well-suited to version control *per se*, because they live on the LMS.  I wanted local files, with repos I can share with other designers and instrutors.  

A secondary problem this library solves is that of images.  Images on Canvas are bare, and it's easy to end up with duplicate versions, as well as not have alt text.  By using markdown/html under version control, I can write my alt text directly into page source, instead of using the crappy click-heavy interface on Canvas.

# Core concept: Containerization of content to be published to Canvas

Containerization is accomplished by making pages/assignments live in folders.  The name of the folder is arbitrary; the metadata for the page lives in a JSON file, while the page itself is simply a markdown file.  That is, the structure of a page/assignment to be published on Canvas, using this library, is

- folder
  - `meta.json` -- a json file containing attributes.  keys should be compliant with the expectations of `canvasapi`.
  - `source.md` -- a markdown file.  Can contain latex math, html, references to local images, emoji using double-colon notation and shortcodes, and of course online images.

# Testing

This library comes with several test pages/assignments:
- pages:  
  - `plain_text` -- source is just plain old text.  start simple, ya know?
  - `uses_latex` -- a page that contains latex math
  - `has_remote_images` -- a page that has remote images embedded
  - `has_local_images` -- a page that uses local images
  - `uses_droplets` -- a page using [the Droplets framework from UWEX](https://media.uwex.edu/app/droplets/index.html).
  - `uses_droplets_via_style` -- a page using [the Droplets framework from UWEX](https://media.uwex.edu/app/droplets/index.html).  The code enabling Droplets comes from a header/footer contained in a style folder.  The main purpose of this test page is the header/footer style thing.
- assignments:
- `programming_assignment` -- an assignment that has a local image

The above list is not exhaustive.

# Installation

1. Clone the repo / pull from the repo
2. Move to repo location in terminal
3. `pip install .`   If you already had it installed, then use `pip install . --upgrade` to make sure you get the newer version.

## Critical setup step, do not skip this

You must also define an environment variable called `CANVAS_CREDENTIAL_FILE`, which is the location of a `.py` file containing two variables:
1. `API_URL` -- a string, the url of how to access your Canvas install.  
  - At UW Eau Claire, it's `https://uweau.instructure.com/`.  
  - I cannot possibly tell you your url, but your local Canvas admin can.
2. `API_KEY` -- a string, the key you can get from Canvas.  Here's [a link to a guide on how to generate yours](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-obtain-an-API-access-token-in-the-Canvas-Data-Portal/ta-p/157).  Do not share it with anyone -- having only this one piece of data, anyone can act as you.  Protect it at least as much as you would any other password or sensitive information.

# Some quick examples

This library is under active development.  I suggest checking out the `test_*.py` files in the `test` folder for example code.

Assuming you did my setup step, defining the environment variable and creating that file.  Do that first.

### Download all pages, with a filter on the name of the pages

```
import markdown2canvas as mc
course_id = 127210000000003099 # silviana's sandbox for development

canvas = mc.make_canvas_api_obj() # gets link and api key via environment variable
course = canvas.get_course(course_id)

destination = 'downloaded_pages'

my_filter = lambda title: 'üìñ' in title # pages about readings have an open book in their names.
mc.download_pages(destination, course, even_if_exists=True, name_filter=my_filter)
```

# Things you can do with this library

## Replacements during translation

The purpose of this library is to increase modularity and flexibility, while reducing duplication in source code and allowing version control.  I implemented a simple text replacement feature as part of this, so that I can create uniform appearances in my content without duplicate code.  

That is, you can specify a set of string replacements using a .json file, and during translation from markdown to html, before uploading, each substitution happens.  

For example, you can create a `replacements.json` file in a folder at root level (relative to the folder for the course) called `_course_metadata`, and in this file put the content:

```
{
  "$TASKDIV": "",
  "REPLACE THIS TEXT": "with this text",
  "$RICKROLL": "<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=BqTm4nbZOLTHaxnz\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",
  "another source replacement with spaces": "destination_without_spaces"
}
``` 

I'm using simple python `.replace` to do the replacements.  There are consequences:
* It will replace strings exactly, there are no implemented efforts to allow patterns or functions.  
* It's case sensitive, and includes exact spacing.  
* The dollar signs above are NOT special.  They're just a nice way to indicate the text will be replaced.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Furthermore, I'm not sure what order the replacements will be done in, so if the target of one replacement includes the source of another, I can't guarantee you at this time that it will actually happen in a deterministic order.  If you want this feature, please add it and submit a PR to this repo.

You can specify a default set of replacements to happen for every file (except those with overridden replacements).  To do this, make a file `_course_metadata/defaults.json`, and create a record `"replacements": "relative/path/to/replacements_filename.json"`.  The name of the replacements file is arbitrary, and it's relative to root of the course folder.

To override the default replacements, put a record in the `meta.json` file for the content (page / assignment) of the form `"replacements": "relative/path/to/replacements_filename.json"`.

Examples of content using replacements can be found in the `test/` folder of this repository.

If a replacements file doesn't exist where you say it should, an exception will be raised at `publish` time for the `CanvasObject` (`Page` or `Assignment`).  (You can construct a thing with a bad replacements file and not know it until you try to publish!)


## Referencing existing Canvas assignments, pages, and files


To link to an existing Canvas assignment, use a link of the form

```[Test Assignment](assignment:Test Assignment)```

To link to an existing Canvas page, use a link of the form

```<a href="page:Test Page">Link to page titled Test Page</a>```

To link to an existing Canvas file, use a link of the form

```
Mckenzie, please write this!  DOCUMENTATION NEEDED HERE FOR FILES
```

If the "existing" content doesn't yet exist when the content is published, a broken link will be made.  This is ok.  Think of the publishing process using Markdown2Canvas similar to the compilation of a TeX document, which is done in multiple passes.  Once the page / assignment / file exists, the link will resolve correctly to it.  Publish all content about twice to get links to resolve.

## Emoji conversion from shortcodes

This library supports the automatic conversion of shortcodes to emoji.  For example, `:open_book:` goes to üìñ.  I use the [`emoji`](https://pypi.org/project/emoji/) library to do this.  [Shortcodes can be found here](https://carpedm20.github.io/emoji/).

Right now, emoji shortcodes can only be used in content, not in names of things -- shortcodes in names will not be emojized.

## Automatic uploading and warehousing of images and embedded content

List your images relative the folder containing the `source.md` for the content.  

## "Styling" -- Automatic inclusion of uniform headers and footers

This library attempts to provide a way to uniformly style pages across sections of content.  In particular, I have provided a mechanism to programmatically concatenate headers and footers onto markdown content before publishing.  Example application of this might be:

* I have content in my course in four blocks, and want a different header for each block.  But, copypasta for that header content sucks (avoid repitition is a key tenet of programming).  So, I'd rather specify a "style" for the four blocks, and make the pages refer to the styles.  
* I use Droplets from UWEX, and don't want to have to put that code in *every single page*.  I'd rather put it one place (or, at least, only a few places).  So the html code that brings in Droplets lives in a header/footer html code file.

### Style basics

Put your "style" folders in a folder in your course.  In my DS150 course, I have the following structure:

* `_styles/`
  * `/generic.style`
  * `/assignments.style`

And in the `meta.json` file for the pages / assignments, I simply have to put the record `"style":"_styles/generic.style"` or whatever. 

As of July 2022, there is no default style -- if a page doesn't list a style, it gets no style.

### Additional notes about styles:

The folder for each style should have the following four files:
* `header.html`
* `header.md`
* `footer.md`
* `footer.html`

They'll get concatenated around `source.md` in that order.  HTML around markdown, and header/footer around source.  

If you want to use images in your header/footer, put them in the markdown part (even if they appear in html tags), and use the text `$PATHTOMD2CANVASSTYLEFILE` before typing the name of the file, so that its filepath gets listed correctly.  (This happens via a simple string replacement)



## Assignments

### Possible Upload Types

In the `meta.json` file for an assignment, the submission type is encoded by a line that looks like the following. 

```
"submission_types":['online_text_entry', 'online_url', 'media_recording', 'online_upload']
```

These are four of the five upload types available with Canvas. The other is an annotation. You may omit this line or include any sublist of this list. If you choose to allow online upload, you may also specify the allowable file types by including an allowed extensions list in your `meta.json` file for the assignment.

```
"allowed_extensions": ["pdf","docx"]
```


## Links

You can hold links in modules under version control, similar to `Page` and `Assignment` types.  One file is needed in the folder:

1. `meta.json`  A valid json file containing something like:

```
{
  "name":"üçì an automatically uploaded link, to amethyst.youcanbook.me",
  "type":"ExternalUrl",
  "external_url":"https://amethyst.youcanbook.me",
  "modules":["Automatically Added Test Module"],
  "new_tab":1
}
```

# Future work ‚ö†Ô∏è this is not yet implemented in `mc`

## Containerization of quizzess ‚ö†Ô∏è this is not yet implemented in `mc`

I want this so badly, but I'm not up to it yet.  I'd love a contribution!

## Due dates ‚ö†Ô∏è this is not yet implemented in `mc`


Due dates are encoded relative to the first day of class, by week number and day of week.  Week numbers start at 1.

| Day code | Day of week | 
| --- | --- |
| M | Monday |
| T | Tuesday |
| W | Wednesday |
| R | Thursday |
| F | Friday |
| Sa | Saturday |
| Su | Sunday |

In the `meta.json` file for an assignment, the due date is encoded like this example:

```
"due":{"time":"10pm", "week":11, "day":"R"}
```

A default time for all assignents can be set in `_course_metadata/defaults.json` with entry `"due_time":"10pm"`, for example.  If this record is not present, and no due time is set for an individual assignment, then the Canvas default time for the course will be used.  On UWEC's system, this can be changed in the course settings. The default value is 11:59pm.

The first day of class is set ...  HOW??
